# TakeABreak

An application that can be used in the classroom to engage students when they take a break, either when asked to by a teacher or choosen by them.  It makes them identify their feeling and then show a short video based on the feeling they identified.  Finally, a timer will be displayed and encouragement to take deep breaths.  This will make taking a break more purposeful.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## Libraries & Frameworks

* React.js

## Project Status

The landing and about page are currently finished and deployed.  They are responsive to mobile devices.

## My Experience and Takeaways 

* I'm learning that responsive design does not need to be overly complicated. I'm trying to make it as responsive with as few lines of code possible.  
* As someone with some UX/UI experience, I really enjoy taking it from design to development.  Using Figm for CSS code makes it quicker to scale up the website.

### Next Actions

* Make the 'start' button functional and add the pages to take the child through the break without fully developing each page.
* After that, then I will style each of the pages of the break.
